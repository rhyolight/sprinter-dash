In these cases, the input coordinates may very rarely match exactly and the large radius ensures that the encodings still have overlap for similar, but not exact, coordinates. In this case the caching mechanism would just slow the function down.

Automated NuPIC build systems can download and bind to all versions of the core library.\r\n2. The Windows NuPIC Core deployment package is compatible with Windows NuPIC.\r\n\r\nRelates to \"Windows binary build and deployment\" https://github.com/numenta/nupic/issues/1786\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe currently planned route forward is;\r\n- [ ] **1.** [Finish the current C++ extension work.](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core/issues/566)\r\n- [ ] **2.** [Python 3.5 support for Windows only, with 2.7 for all other OS.](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] **3.** [MinGW GCC and/or LLVM clang support.](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core/issues/568)\r\n\r\nAll items rely on SWIG and binding work being complete, or close to. With the first item requiring A few more days to wrangle the build, and determine whether this is a dead-end. \r\n\r\nThe second route has some uncertainty over how long 3.5 support in a 2.7 code base will take. The Core library is virtually ready. And with Austin's investigation we should be able to judge how long this could be. Only 2to3 and six changes in NuPIC Python?  Uncertainty over 2to3 timing and ongoing support. Existing installed 3.x Python needs rebuilding with VS2015? Code review changes?  \r\n\r\nThe third item tries a more recent TDM-GCC package with script ideas from https://github.com/develersrl/gccwinbinaries  This should be a simple change to the Core lib building. Will need Travis and AppVeyor scripts and Yaml updating, taking into account CI automated build limits (40 mins maximum on AppVeyor). It didn't take too long, before the C++11 adoption, to update the Core and NuPIC to use the correct VC compiler and Window's SDK. Getting to a point of needing MySQL setup properly for some of the tests. Adding the compiler is straight forward, adding the appropriate SDK may take longer. Similar to route 1 there may still be issues and a possible need to build and supply Python from source.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nA C++0X compiled Core library can be used with Python 2.7 (x64), as was demonstrated a while back https://gist.github.com/rcrowder/5fd1e964bf1bd6881c34 But with the adoption of more C++11 language features, there became a need to use more recent Visual C compilers. But doing so broke the ability to compiler extensions for Python 2.7 on Windows.\r\n\r\nIt looks possible to use various tricks and tweaks to get a build working using a mix of compilers and SDKs. But first see Piotr Dobrogost reply here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3047542/building-lxml-for-python-2-7-on-windows/5122521#5122521 and a more detailed discussion here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2484511/can-i-use-visual-studio-2010s-c-compiler-with-visual-studio-2008s-c-runtim?lq=1\r\n\r\nMost seem to advocate dropping language features to use older compilers, moving away from certain C++11 features. That is possible but impracticable for NuPIC. Adding support for GCC and clang seems a likely next route to take. Visual C compilers have been lagging behind with certain C++11 features, with clang having the most features covered (so a favorite to move to over MinGW/Cygwin GCC). An alternative answer within the former linked SO article replies, is to look into Cython extensions. A risky task of unknown size.\r\n\r\nWith the release of Python 3.5 seeing support for Visual Studio 2015, that opens a route that would solve this issue. But could lead to trying to adapt to 3.x only, or have mixed support of 2.7 and 3.x! (split repos?). Microsoft's efforts of late to support Python within the Visual Studio IDE do look great thou. https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/python-vs.aspx https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRdLgGAdrb_YeTdEnd23s6Ff\r\n\r\nAlternative Python packages exists such as WinPython, Anaconda, Python(x,y), etc. Most, if not all, relying on older 2010 or 2013 compiler versions. NuPIC Core relies on Visual Studio 2015, and the latest Visual C compilers, and so has similar build issues to what we currently face.\r\n\r\n**TODO** -Format this super-issue and arrange sub-issues.
